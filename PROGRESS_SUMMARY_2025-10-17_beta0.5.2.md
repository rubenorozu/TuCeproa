# Progress Summary - Beta 0.5.2

This document summarizes the changes implemented to enhance the functionality and user experience for `ADMIN_RESOURCE` profiles within the TuCeproa web application.

## Implemented Changes:

### 1. Session Context (`context/SessionContext.tsx`):
-   **User Session Data:** Modified the `UserSession` interface to explicitly include `firstName` and `lastName` properties. The `setUser` call was updated to correctly store these properties from the API response, ensuring that the full name of the logged-in user is available throughout the application via the session.

### 2. Admin Spaces Page (`app/admin/spaces/page.tsx`):
-   **Access Control for ADMIN_RESOURCE:**
    -   The `useEffect` hook responsible for redirection was updated to allow `ADMIN_RESOURCE` users to access the "Gestión de Espacios" page.
    -   The main access control check within the component's render logic was modified to grant access to both `SUPERUSER` and `ADMIN_RESOURCE` roles.
-   **Filtering Spaces by Responsibility:**
    -   The `fetchSpaces` function was updated to accept an optional `responsibleUserId` parameter.
    -   The `useEffect` hook that triggers `fetchSpaces` was modified to pass the `user.id` of the logged-in `ADMIN_RESOURCE` user, ensuring that they only view spaces for which they are responsible.
-   **Responsible User Display in Modal (Edit/Add Space):**
    -   The `ResponsibleUser` interface was updated to use `firstName` and `lastName` for consistency with the session data.
    -   The rendering within the `Form.Select` for responsible users was adjusted to display the `firstName` and `lastName`.
    -   The `handleShowModal` function was modified to pre-fill the `form.responsibleUserId` with the current `ADMIN_RESOURCE` user's ID when adding a new space.
    -   The "ID de Usuario Responsable" field was transformed into a read-only input for `ADMIN_RESOURCE` users:
        -   When adding a new space, it displays the full name (`firstName` and `lastName`) of the currently logged-in `ADMIN_RESOURCE` user.
        -   When editing an existing space, it displays the full name (`firstName` and `lastName`) of the assigned responsible user.
    -   The `Form.Select` for responsible users is now always disabled for `ADMIN_RESOURCE` users, preventing them from changing the assigned responsible user.

### 3. Admin Equipment Page (`app/admin/equipment/page.tsx`):
-   **Access Control for ADMIN_RESOURCE:**
    -   The `useEffect` hook responsible for redirection was updated to allow `ADMIN_RESOURCE` users to access the "Gestión de Equipos" page.
    -   The main access control check within the component's render logic was modified to grant access to both `SUPERUSER` and `ADMIN_RESOURCE` roles.
-   **Filtering Equipment by Responsibility:**
    -   The `fetchEquipment` function was updated to accept an optional `responsibleUserId` parameter.
    -   The `useEffect` hook that triggers `fetchEquipment` was modified to pass the `user.id` of the logged-in `ADMIN_RESOURCE` user, ensuring that they only view equipment for which they are responsible.
-   **Responsible User Display in Modal (Edit/Add Equipment):**
    -   The `ResponsibleUser` interface was updated to use `firstName` and `lastName`.
    -   The rendering within the `Form.Select` for responsible users was adjusted to display the `firstName` and `lastName`.
    -   The `handleShowModal` function was modified to pre-fill the `form.responsibleUserId` with the current `ADMIN_RESOURCE` user's ID when adding new equipment.
    -   The "ID de Usuario Responsable" field was transformed into a read-only input for `ADMIN_RESOURCE` users:
        -   When adding new equipment, it displays the full name (`firstName` and `lastName`) of the currently logged-in `ADMIN_RESOURCE` user.
        -   When editing an existing equipment, it displays the full name (`firstName` and `lastName`) of the assigned responsible user.
    -   The `Form.Select` for responsible users is now always disabled for `ADMIN_RESOURCE` users.

    -   The `useEffect` hook responsible for redirection was updated to allow `ADMIN_RESOURCE` users to access the "Gestión de Talleres" page.
