# Progress Summary - Beta 0.5.3

This document summarizes the changes implemented in version Beta 0.5.3.

## Implemented Changes:

### 1. Admin Dashboard Cards (`app/admin/page.tsx`):
-   **Image Display Optimization:**
    -   Applied `objectFit: 'contain'` to all `Image` components within the card placeholders (Users, Spaces, Equipment, Workshops, Inscriptions) to ensure the entire image is visible within the placeholder height.
    -   Added `backgroundColor: 'white'` to the `div` container of each `Image` component to provide a clean background for images that do not fill the entire container.
-   **Reservation Approval/Rejection Confirmation:**
    -   Modified the `handleApproveReject` function to only display a confirmation prompt (`window.confirm`) when the action is `'reject'`. Approval actions now proceed without a confirmation prompt.

### 2. API Routes for Reservations (`app/api/admin/reservations/[id]/approve/route.ts` and `app/api/admin/reservations/[id]/reject/route.ts`):
-   **Access Control:** Updated the access control conditions in both the `approve` and `reject` API routes to include `Role.ADMIN_RESOURCE`, allowing users with this role to perform these actions.
